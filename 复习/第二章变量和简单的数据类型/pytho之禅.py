f Python, by Tim Peters
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
Tim Peters的《巨蟒之禅》


美胜于丑。

外显优于内隐。

简单胜过复杂。

复杂胜于复杂。

扁平优于嵌套。

疏比密。

可读性是重要的。

特殊案件不足以打破规则。

虽然实用胜过纯粹。

错误决不能悄无声息地通过。

除非明确沉默。

面对模棱两可，拒绝猜测的诱惑。

应该有一个——最好只有一个——显然是这样做的。

虽然这种方式起初并不明显，除非你是荷兰人。

现在总比没有强。

虽然现在从来没有比现在更好。

如果实现很难解释，那是个坏主意。

如果实现容易解释，那可能是个好主意。

名称空间是一个伟大的想法-让我们做更多的！
